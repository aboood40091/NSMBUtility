0.5.) Running the software

    Requirements:

        - Windows (OS X and Linux aren't likely to support this. TESTERS NEEDED)
        - Python 3
        - Wiimms SZS Toolset (if you want to compress your levels)



    You can run NSMBUtility.py by pasting the following in the Command Prompt:

        cd {path}
            {path} is the place you saved the program (desktop recommend!)

        python NSMBUtility.py
            This will run the program. Enjoy!
            


1.) Installation and step 1, creating environment

    Extract the .zip after downloading it. Move NSMBUtility.py to your desktop, and run the it.
    Select the first option in the menu, and follow the steps. Remember, it will create a folder
    on your C:\ partition. You might be able to change this folder in a new version. After step
    one is completed, you return to the menu, where you type in 7, to exit it. After that, move
    the NSMBUtility.py to the created folder: C:\Wii U. You will also see three other folders.
    Anything you generate and download with NSMBUtility.py, will be stored in these three folders.
    Obviously, they can be copied to other places, but NSMBUtility.py will always store his things
    in the original folder, C:\Wii U.
    
    
2.) Option 2, creating Cafiine folder structure
    
    This step is quite simple: it will create the needed folders to run your own custom level with
    Cafiine. The games where this program is meant for (NSMBU, NSLU and NSMBU + NSLU (on 1 disc))
    are all supported. Of course you can copy the files to your main Cafiine folder. This only works
    if you select the right region (of the disc) in the program!
    
    
3.) Option 3, download latest Reggie Next!
    
    With this option, the program will automatically download the latest version of Reggie Next!
    with NSMBU and NSLU support. However, it's not possible (yet) to download the latest version
    while using V1.0. So with every new release of the editor, expect a new version of NSMBUtility
    within a few days.
    
    
4.) Option 4, downloading latest spritedata (recommended)

    It's a good idea to run option 4 at least once a week. It will update the spritedata from Reggie
    Next!. This option is configured with the Reggie Next! from option 3, so expect an error if you
    copied your own download of the editor into the C:\Wii U\Reggie Next! folder.
    
    
5.) Option 5, .sarc to .szs converter

    To use this option, you must have the program Wiimms SZS Toolset installed (so choose the right
    version for your OS and install it). In my case, running W10 64B, I downloaded the latest cygwin
    version for windows. After that, I installed both windows-install.exe and sendto-install.bat. After
    succesfully installing those, restart your PC. Then follow the steps in option 5 in NSMBUtility.py.
    
    If you have any error installing windows-install or sendto-install, you can ask one of the members
    to help you, here: https://gbatemp.net/threads/wiimms-szs-tools.286476/
    But be sure you downloaded the right version, and uninstall and install it again if it gives you an
    error or any other problems!
    
    
6.) Option 6, for problems and errors with NSMBU & NSLU hacking

    This option sends you to the the fora on the rhcafe. Here you can ask things about NSMBU and NSLU
    hacking. You can ask everything you want in threads you make, as long as it has something to do with
    hacking these games. You can also post your NSMBU / NSLU projects on this site. So sign up, and ask
    whatever you want and start a project!
    
    
7.) Option 7, exiting the program

    You can exit the program by choosing 7 in the main menu. If you ever want to stop it, while not being
    in the main menu, you can just click the red cross, in the upper-right corner. However, when you do
    this while downloading or converting, your download and level will most likely become corrupted. In other
    words, please exit the program only by choosing 7 in the main menu, to prevend any problems and errors.
    
    
8.) Enjoy, and don't forget to have fun!


9.) Thanks to you!
